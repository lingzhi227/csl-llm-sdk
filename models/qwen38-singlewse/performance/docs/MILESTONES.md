# Performance milestones

## P0: checked graph and executable stream foundation

Status: source and simulator milestone. The full-model 2,000 tokens/s target has
not been reached. Physical transport qualification is a separate pending step.

Implemented and checked:

- All 1,172 original semantic operators, 1,251 text tensors and 64 layers imported into
  an explicit dependency/region representation; intra-token KV ordering and
 113 delayed state/token-feedback edges are explicit. Physical region placement
  is unassigned, rather than filled with hypothetical coordinates.
- Deterministic stream-to-PE-to-CSL lowering for a rooted 2D multicast and
  acknowledgement tree; manual geometry, packet, color, queue and task controls.
  The restricted verifier checks route continuity, resource collisions, coverage
  and estimated SRAM. This is not a generic arbitrary-graph deadlock proof.
- Seven source tests pass. Complete 3x4 simulator suites 006/008 pass all 5 cases,
  including changed inputs, restarted requests,33/256-word payloads and 128 rounds.
  All endpoint packets, epoch counts, child counts and independent root sums pass.
- 16x16 simulator 007 compiled all 256 PEs and passed its first 2 cases, including 64 rounds
  of 33 words at 2,176.03125 root cycles/roundtrip. It was stopped when observed simulator
  cost showed the complete suite would exceed its 240-second budget. This is a
  partial simulator result, not a full physical or full-model performance result.
- An independent IEEE encoding proof covers 254 finite FP8 codes and 64,516 products.
  It identifies a possible table-free mixed-precision kernel, with device
  subnormal behavior and accumulation correctness still unqualified.

Failed attempts are preserved. Simulator 001 rejected non-symbol export operands;
002 hit the bounded process/thread limit before actual compilation; 003 timed out;
004 exposed a device assertion, and 005 captured the actual checker error: epoch 1
returned the correct sum 90 while its multiply-based check evaluated to 65,610.
006 uses an incrementally maintained device check while the host independently
retains the closed-form formula. No numerical tolerance was relaxed. The cause
of the original integer expression requires a separate compiler/arithmetic probe;
it is not presented as a proven general compiler defect.

For the initial local compile, explicit process CPU affinity corrected LLVM's
thread creation failure without raising the 64-task limit. Simulator fatal-log
monitoring now terminates a halted simulator promptly. Hard memory/no-swap,
CPU/runtime and shared-lock limits remain in force.

## Next evidence

Physical 256 PE transport cycles and normal allocation release; then native
mixed FP16/FP32 operator qualification, packed vector decode, regional GEMV and
reduction scheduling. Full-model speed claims require full-model evidence.
