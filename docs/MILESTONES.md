# Accepted milestones

## WP02 — Accepted, September 10, 2026

Two adjacent PEs split the original tile into two 56-column contractions, send
partial FP32 results over fabric, SUM on the receiving PE and normalize 128 elements
with unit gain. Four calls passed all independent stage/approximation/state gates
and exercised local-first and receive-complete-first joins. Normal SDK stop/exit
was recorded. This is an on-wafer reduced chain, not physical cluster inference.
See [report](WP02-REPORT.md) and [evidence](../evidence/wp02.json).

## WP01 — Accepted, September 10, 2026

An original 128×112 BF16 up-projection slice completed four calls in one runtime,
including changed input, exact last-column one-hot and zero-after-nonzero. All
weight/guard/counter/handle checks passed; normal SDK stop and process exit were
recorded. See [report](WP01-REPORT.md). This is a local GEMV tile, not full inference.

## WP00 — September 10, 2026

Resource admission, serial heavy-task locking and three host bit codecs; a single
WSE-3 PE copied seven BF16 raw bit patterns with native MEMCPY_16BIT on SDK 2.10.1.
H2D, device copy and D2H preserved `0000 8000 3f80 bf80 7f80 ff80 7fc1`.
SDK stop returned normally and both compiler/simulator processes exited zero.

Outer wall times were 4.083871 s for compilation and 2.058936 s for simulation.
These include container/service overhead and are not hardware performance.
The first attempt failed before compilation due to host/container mounting; the
controller approved a corrected launch with unchanged CSL/driver source.

This milestone establishes a tiny transfer control, not BF16 arithmetic, request
reset, packed-stream SDK support, model generation or physical cluster inference.
Fourteen lightweight host tests pass. See [WP00 report](WP00-REPORT.md) and
[compact evidence](../evidence/wp00.json). Future entries require scoped acceptance.
